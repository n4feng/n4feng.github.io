I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Dalhousie University, specializing in Machine Learning. My academic journey has been driven by a deep passion for optimizing large language model (LLM) making the answer more reliable and relevant to user interest.

My current research focuses on developing reliable framwork for evaluating factuality of LLM output. In particular, I am working on leverage related documents in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to provide a better evaluation.

Feel free to connect with me.
